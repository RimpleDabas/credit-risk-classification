# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis

- For this analysis various techniques are used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.
- The dataset id from the historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company 
- The purpose is to build model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

- The values to be predited from model were the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels 
- Following steps were performed :
   - Read the file `lending_data.csv`
   - Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
